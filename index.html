    <p>As a Junior studying computer science, and an editor of Michigan’s satire newspaper, The Every Three Weekly, I am fascinated with online social platforms and communication tools. As a programmer, I have used the Twitter API for various personal web application projects. As an editor for a campus paper, I have used Twitter to promote readership and increase online traffic. My specialty in web development as well as my interest in social media outlets is why I am writing to express interest in software development internships offered by Twitter.</p>
    <p>Having held two internships in the software development field, I have gained an understanding of how to work as a team, the importance of making deadlines, and the significance of meeting company coding standards. At my first internship position with BioTelemetery Inc., I was responsible for managing the content displayed on overhead monitors. That content included web pages I developed to analyze shipping order data, call center response time, and companywide announcements. Before I started at the company, the overhead monitors had been set up but went unused for months, as no employees had become familiar with the tools used to operate them. After my summer with the company, the monitors are now used every day and have proper documentation.</p>
    <p>For my second internship, I joined the performance monitoring team at Bentley Systems. During my time at Bentley, I was exposed to team programming on a professional level. I wrote and modified programs that helped speed up the process of running performance tests and analyzing server data. I modified existing programs to run from the command line, so they could be called automatically, saving time and human effort in generating performance data. I also developed many other specialized performance tests and miniature applications to accelerate setting up performancecounter analysis tools.</p>
    <p>My interest in computers extends beyond the workplace. I have taken on the role of webmaster for The University of Michigan Running Club, where I redesigned a more mobile responsive and artistically sound website. I have created multiple web applications using the Twitter API, one of which is a bot designed to like my friend’s tweets on my behalf, and I have started working on one the involves tweet scheduling and drafting. Programming has always been more than a job to me; it is an interest I pursue in my free time regularly and a creative outlet that sparks my imagination.</p>
    <p>I know that with my passion for creative media and web development I would be a positive addition to the team at Twitter. Please consider me for this position, and feel free to contact me at (484) 302-6415 with any questions or for additional information. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

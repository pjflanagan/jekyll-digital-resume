    <p>As a Junior studying computer science, and an editor of Michiganâ€™s satire newspaper, The Every Three Weekly, I am fascinated with online social platforms and communication tools. As a programmer, I have used the Twitter API for various personal web application projects. As an editor for a campus paper, I have used Twitter to promote readership and increase online traffic. My specialty in web development as well as my interest in social media outlets is why I am writing to express interest in software development internships offered by Twitter.</p>

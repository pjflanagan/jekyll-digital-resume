				<div class="header">ABOUT ME</div>
				<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-left:0;margin-top:-10px;font-size:18px;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterjflan">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peterjflan">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://instagram.com/pjflanagan1/">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings?trk=prof-edit-edit-public_profile">LinkedIn</a></h1>
				<p>I just obtained this domain (special thanks to MHacks).  While this website is a work in progress, I wanted to share it so you can learn a little about me. </p>
				<p>I'm Peter Flanagan, and I am a computer science major at the University of Michigan. I was born in rainy Seattle Washington, and moved around until the third grade when I found my home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I began programming in middle school when my computer applications teacher told me I made a great looking website. That year I submitted a website on Fractal Geometry to the <a href="https://seelio.com/w/10v9/pennsylvania-state-computer-fair?student=flanapet">PA State Computer Fair</a>. I won second place at the state finals and was now hooked on computer science.</p>
				<p>Since then I have learned a lot and I have improved my web designing skills.  I have continued to do some graphic design and have significantly expanded my programming knowledge into other areas.  The following is a sample of what I have been up to. </p>
	

				<div class="header">PORTFOLIO</div>

				<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-left:0;margin-top:-10px;font-size:18px;"><a href="http://www.seelio.com/flanapet">Seelio Portfolio</a> | <a href="http://www.github.com/pjflanagan">Github</a></h1>

				<a href="/MRun/"><h1>MRun</h1></a>
				<p>Click here to view the Michigan Running Club website project I am currently creating. Assuming I am elected MRun Webmaster, I will be responsible for updating and managing the Running Club website as well as other online communications. I am especially excited about this role as I have been a dedicated runner since middle school and continue to compete in college. </p>
				
				<a href="/PaceCalculator"><h1>Pace Calculator</h1></a>
				<p>I also love fonts and minimalism. If you feel the same then check out this Pace Calculator used for calculating splits in running competitions. It features two of my favorite fonts and uses only two colors. It works great on mobile too.  I had many running friends use it in high school and now have a new fan club at Michigan. </p>
				
				<a href="/art/ColorsOfPi"><h1>Colors Of Pi</h1></a>
				<p>This is a more "artsy" project that depicts the hexadecimal colors that pi makes when you split pi into sixes. Using python, I took a text file with the digits of pi, then split them up every six characters and saved them into an html file as div tags. For example: 3.14159 becomes #314159, which is a shade of blue, and 265358 becomes #262358 which is a shade of greyish-green.  Check out the site.  It is actually pretty cool, especially if you like math. If you are a true nerd, then make it your desktop screen saver! Also if you're interested, the source code for the python file that parses pi and creates this page will be available online soon.</p>

				<a href="/art/PixelClick.htm"><h1>Pixel Click</h1></a>
				<p>Another art project I've made is this basic drawing page that allows users to design pixelated art. It was a fun weekend project that showcases the HTML5 canvas pretty well.</p>

				<a href="/art/strobe"><h1>Audio Visualizer</h1></a>
				<p>My most recent project is designing an audio visualizer to showcase a friend's Soundcloud songs. Bill+Andrey, from Boston University, is a small band making digital guitar riffs from their dorm room. The code for this project is also going to be used to create a strobe light that varies with the song being played using an Arduino in the near future.</p>

				<a href="/art/RandomWalks.htm"><h1>Random Walks</h1></a>
				<p>This is an art project that bears resemblance to a screen saver. A random walk is a mathematical concept that describes natural movements, like the path a dandelion seed takes in the wind. That means taking a step at a fixed size in one direction, then turning to a random direction and taking another step of the same size. This page takes that math concept and turns it into art.</p>

				<a href="http://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib02/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/471/desmondwebsite/index.html"><h1>Desmond Project</h1></a>
				<p>This is a remodeled version of the webpage I made sophomore year high school for a class called, "The Desmond Partnership." This partnership with a local business is the only class of its kind in the country, and offers high school students real world work experience from the classroom. Each year the class fills jobs, raises money, and hosts the school's Student Achiever Banquet, which honors hand selected students for their accomplishments. The website is currently not under my managment, but the basic design is still in use.</p>

				<div class="header">CONTACT</div>
				<p>I'm working on adding more of my art projects and previous working website designs onto here in addition to spicing up this page itself.  Check back in March to see my updates.  In the meantime, if you are looking for a summer intern with a passion for computer science and web design, please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:pjflanagan1@gmail.com" target="_blank">pjflanagan1@gmail.com</a>. You can also access my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N3cUQdC13cQLbZvUauE21T9Ftnz1HUuOHCwmrTjnuwQ&authuser=0" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> by clicking the link. </p>

				<div class="header">BACCALAUREATE SPEECH</div>
				<p>Thanks for making it this far down the page! Please enjoy this video of my Baccalaureate speech before graduation my senior year.</p>

				These are some final basic old high school websites I've designed that do not look as good anymore. If you're the kind of person that likes to look back reflectivley and see a person's progression through the years, then you can use this one as a base.

The Baccalaureate is a ceremony put on by the high school several nights before graduation. It's similar to graduation, but with less people and no awards. So, while not as elegant, the Baccalaureate offered a more personal and less professional environment for speakers to share their thoughts. I was lucky enough to be selected to speak.

It&#39;s just like The Bachelorette but spelled differently and not at all.</p>&mdash; Peter James Flanagan (@PeterJFlan) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterJFlan/status/474279053114216448">June 4, 2014</a></blockquote>

My call to action went relatively unanswered, as the auditorium was not crowded during my speech, but it still went swimmingly. You can watch it here:

A while back my high school friend visited from the west coast where he moved to after high school. He was staying at my house for a night so we decided to do something we used to do all the time in high school: complete a pointless project.

We began by taking an Easy Button I had lying around. Now I had seen a product earlier called bttn, ![The finished product]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/easy.gif){: .right}which allowed a user to set a single button to complete any task online. I wanted to create a version of that myself using an Arduino. Now I don't have a WiFi or Ethernet shield, so accessing the internet was out of the question, but that would be an entire different task that would be equally as daunting.

We began unscrewing the Easy Button to find regular button parts that make it spring, a speaker to make it talk, wires that led to the batteries, and a small computer chip with a button in the middle. After an hour or so of toying around with different parts and shorting the circuit one way or another, we assessed which parts were important, and decided we didn't need batteries or the current speaker. We decided we would trace wires up through the battery holder, into the button and then connect them onto the circuit board.

The circuit board was the most difficult part. We kept trying to find different solder blobs and components to connect the wires to, none of which were working. We began to scratch off protective coating on the wires and found that using those wires worked better, but it was difficult to hold the wires on with just hot glue (I don't own soldering equipment). We found after some trial and error, that we can simply jam the wires underneath the rubbery button on the circuit board, and as long as they didn't slide around, we were golden.

We quickly put the button back together, sealed in the wires with hot glue, and hooked it up to the Arduino.

Now the light was just set to constantly be on, and when the button was pressed the circuit was cut off and the light went off. Using this knowledge we began to code something simple so that it would simulate a light switch.

The code wasn't particularly difficult to write. If the button was being pressed and the light was off, turn it on, and vice versa. If the button wasn't being pressed, prepare for the next time it would be pressed. I'm excited to continue exploring the project once I purchase an Ethernet shield. I'll begin using IFTTT's Maker feature to do any number of things, and then essentially I would have a one button, one feature computer.
